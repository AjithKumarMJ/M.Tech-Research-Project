# SecureServerShield: Web Server Security Enhancement

## Overview
SecureServerShield is a robust security solution designed to enhance the security of web servers against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and protect cryptographic keys from unauthorized access. It leverages hardware transactional memory to ensure that web servers can handle increased traffic during DDoS attacks without compromising uptime.

## Features
- **DDoS Attack Mitigation**: SecureServerShield employs hardware transactional memory technology to prevent web servers from becoming overwhelmed during DDoS attacks. This ensures server stability and uptime even under heavy traffic loads.

- **Cryptographic Key Protection**: The project uses the RSA private key algorithm to safeguard cryptographic keys from unauthorized access. Even if an attacker breaches the server and steals the keys, they cannot compromise them because the decryption key is kept secret.

## Installation
To run SecureServerShield, you will need the following prerequisites:
- Visual Studio Ultimate for development.
- SQL Server database for storing server-related data.

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

2. Open the project in Visual Studio Ultimate.

3. Configure the SQL Server database connection in the project settings.

4. Build and run the project to deploy the security enhancements for your web server.

## Usage
Once installed and configured, SecureServerShield will automatically enhance the security of your web server. It handles DDoS attacks gracefully and ensures the protection of your cryptographic keys.
